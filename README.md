Grouping Poverty by District/City in Central Java in 2021 Using K-Means Clustering

## Conclusion
Overall, the poverty situation in Central Java can be observed through several indicators, including the number of people living in poverty, the depth and severity of poverty, the highest human development index, the highest gender development index, families that have not achieved prosperity, inadequate sanitation conditions, unsafe drinking water sources, unemployed populations, and the use of cooking fuels such as firewood, charcoal, or kerosene.
The conclusion drawn from the application of non-hierarchical cluster analysis method with the aim of classifying a group of Kabupaten/Kota in Jawa Tengah Province in 2021, totaling 35 observations, into several clusters based on similarities or common characteristics among observations, resulting in observations within the same cluster having greater similarity than objects outside the cluster. The outcome is that by determining 2 clusters using the silhouette method and K-means cluster analysis as a tool to group them, the cluster groups and members are as follows.

The cluster with the highest poverty rate is cluster 2, consisting of Banjarnegara District, Kebumen District, Purworejo District, Wonosobo District, Magelang District, Wonogiri District, and Semarang District with a percentage of poor population at 13,97%.
This is followed by Cluster 1, consisting of Kabupaten Cilacap, Kabupaten Banyumas, Kabupaten Purbalingga, Kabupaten Boyolali, Kabupaten Klaten, Kabupaten Sukoharjo, Kabupaten Karanganyar, Kabupaten Sragen, Kabupaten Grobogan, Kabupaten Blora, Kabupaten Rembang, Kabupaten Pati, Kabupaten Kudus, Kabupaten Jepara, Kabupaten Demak, Kabupaten Temanggung, Kabupaten Kendal, Kabupaten Batang, Kabupaten Pekalongan, Kabupaten Pemalang, Kabupaten Tegal, Kabupaten Brebes, Kota Magelang, Kota Surakarta, Kota Salatiga, Kota Semarang, Kota Pekalongan, dan Kota Tegal with a percentage of poor population at 10,75%.
Future research potential could focus on specific aspects that may require further attention. For example, in-depth research could be conducted to explore factors contributing to the depth or severity of poverty. Additionally, further investigation into the impact of implemented welfare policies or programs could provide a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of these measures in addressing poverty.
By continually deepening the understanding of the characteristics and dynamics of poverty, it is hoped that this research can make a meaningful contribution to designing more effective policies to reduce and alleviate poverty in Districts/Cities in Central Java Province. Furthermore, it is hoped that this research can inspire future studies focusing on this social issue context
